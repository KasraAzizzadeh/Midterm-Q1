This project is consisted of two verilog files: 1.STACK_BASED_ALU 2.testbench

STACK_BASED_ALU
in this file we define our inputs and our outputs and describe
the logic of our hardware.

testbench
in this file we instantiate our STACK_BASED_ALU and define some reg variables for our test
then by changing the values of these variables we simulate the dunctionality of our
hardware code based on different inputs
