# Description
This project is consisted of two verilog files: 
\n1.STACK_BASED_ALU 
\n2.testbench

## STACK_BASED_ALU
In this file we define our inputs and our outputs and describe
the logic of our hardware.

## testbench
In this file we instantiate our STACK_BASED_ALU and define some wires and reg variables
for our test then by changing the values of these variables we simulate the functionality
of our hardware code based on different inputs.
